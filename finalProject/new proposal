Final Proposal
Project Name: “Sfumato” prototype
Story behind the project: Look at the pdf in the "finalProject" folder

Project Subject:
Use to processing and adruino to create watercolor drops color/shape changing on the screen by changing XYZ sensor.

Instruction: 
There are two parts: a screen and a hand-controled device. The pattern will show on the screen(based on processing)
and the device is for controling when and how the pattern change(based on ardunio). 
1. when hand touch/hold the device, no pattern shows up
2. when hand starts moving, pattern appears
3. when hand keeps moving, depands on the code setting, pattern changed
4. stop moving, pattern will stay
5. after x seconds, pattern will disappear

Add-on task:
1 create more patterns/explore different ways to show the watercolor drops
2 change the way to control the devices(look at the photos in the folder)
3 add a force sensor
