Final Proposal
Project Name: “Sfumato” prototype
Story behind the project: Look at the pdf in the "finalProject" folder

Project Subject:
Use to processing and adruino to create watercolor drops color/shape changing on the screen by changing XYZ sensor. 
Use bluetooth to connect two parts of devices.

Instruction: 
There are two parts: a screen and a hand-controled device. The pattern will show on the screen(based on processing)
and the device is for controling when and how the pattern change(based on ardunio). 
1. when hand touch/hold the device, no pattern shows up
2. when hand starts moving, pattern appears
3. when hand keeps moving, depands on the code setting(x y number), pattern changed
4. stop moving, pattern will stay
5. after x seconds, pattern will disappear

Add-on task:
1 create more patterns/explore different ways to show the watercolor drops
2 add z into the code to make more unexpected moves
3 add a force sensor

Final piece:
When I was using the dictance sensor, I found that it's really hard to find a good interface to let people enjoy the game.
Therefore, I changed it to buttons and mirror box game. 
1. when nobody press the buttons, screen will be black
2. press the buttons ---> images show up
3. use buttons to switch the images
I got some help from my coding friend to make sure that there won't be any problems when I am doing the show. He helped me to refine
the code. What I also learned from this class is that don't be shy to ask for help and people will be happy to help you.
